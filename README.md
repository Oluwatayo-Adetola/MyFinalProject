## 1). Brief Overview of the Project  

1.1   Discussing Interface Interactions of the Application

Tayo Food App is an android application that makes its user’s food fantasies come into reality. The application contains a variety of dishes, along with their appropriate recipes. The recipes are short, quick, easy, which all means it will give the best customer experience. As discussed in lectures, responsible UX design consists of simplistic ways to make its user engaged with the app. Users get engaged to applications through simple interface interactions like tapping, scrolling, swiping. Tayo Food App has interface interactions like tapping and scrolling, which will make the UI experience much smoother for the user. 

The user interface interactions of Tayo Food App were created through the use of layouts. Layouts are structures that help with the orientation of designs in an app. For this app, the main layout used for scrolling was the recycler view layout. The tapping feature was done with a click feature called "setOnClickListener()", which was put on an imageView in a constraint layout. This Kotlin application was built on Android Studio, where the code can be run on android emulators or on android devices.
